# String and Date
-- > A string is a primitive data type in JavaScript used to represent a sequence of characters. Anything you can type—letters, numbers, symbols, punctuation—can be part of a string. It is the primary way we work with textual data.


## Creating Strings
-> There are three ways to create a string literal in JavaScript.
    1.Single Quotes ('...'):

        let singleQuoted = 'Hello, world!';

    2.Double Quotes ("...")

        let doubleQuoted = "He said, 'Hello!'"; // Easy to include single quotes

    3.Template Literals (`...` - ES6)

        let templateLiteral = `This is a template literal.`;
